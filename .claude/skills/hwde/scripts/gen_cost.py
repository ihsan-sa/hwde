"""gen_cost.py - the model cost of generating a board, split by hwde step.

A board's guide and design doc say what it cost to generate: a total, and a
breakdown by hwde step where the records allow one. This script works that
out from the records a run leaves behind and writes it to reports/cost.json,
which guide_facts.py carries into the guide.

It reads, all read-only:
  Claude Code transcripts   ~/.claude/projects/<escaped worktree>/<id>.jsonl
                            plus <id>/subagents/*.jsonl: every model message
                            with its timestamp, model and token usage, and the
                            session's own `cost-state` total at its end. They
                            outlive the worktree and exist for a run that timed
                            out, which the loop log records with no cost.
  reference/model_prices.yaml  USD per million tokens, with its source.
  <ws>/state.json history   when hwde recorded each step (phase, gate and
                            human-checkpoint events; naive local timestamps).
  loop.log (--loop-log)     a headless loop's per-iteration cost, reconciled
                            against the round this call records.

How a message is attributed to a step. hwde records `phase` events when it
enters a phase, and `gate` / `human` events when a phase's exit gate or
checkpoint runs. Spend after a phase event goes to that phase; spend before a
gate or checkpoint goes to the phase that gate closes (erc -> schematic,
place -> placement, drc_routed -> routing, verify -> verification, dfm ->
DFM). Spend before the workspace existed goes to "before the workspace";
spend after the last record goes to the furthest phase reached. A round of
sessions with no hwde record inside its time span is NOT split: it keeps one
line, and `breakdown_reason` says why. Nothing is ever apportioned by guess.

Rounds. A round is a set of sessions with a label. With no --session, the
round is every session in the worktree's Claude project directory (or each
--project-dir) that ran between the workspace's first and last history event,
or in the hour before the first (the run's lead-in: reading the brief and the
skill) - the design run itself, including the session still running. With
--session, exactly those transcripts. --shared-with marks a round that also
worked on something else (another board, the skill): its cost is shown
beside the board's total, never inside it. Results merge into an existing
--out file by session id, so rounds accumulate across runs, and a session
whose transcript is gone keeps the figures it was recorded with.

A session's cost is Claude Code's own recorded total (`cost-state`) or the
priced sum of its messages, whichever is larger: the recorded total also
bills small side calls the transcript does not show, and a session with no
`cost-state` yet (still running, or killed before it wrote one) has only the
priced sum, and says so. The steps split the priced sum; the rest shows as
its own "not in the transcript" line, so the steps always add up to the
total. The loop log's total (--loop-log, reconciled against the round being
recorded) is reported beside it: a timed-out iteration logs no cost. Tokens of a model the price table lacks are reported as
unpriced, never priced by guess.

Exit 0 "pass"       at least one session was found and priced.
Exit 1 "violations" no session found for the workspace - `missing` says where
                    it looked. The existing --out file is left untouched.
Exit 2 "error"      no workspace / unreadable state.json, price table or
                    transcript.
