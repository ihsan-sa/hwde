"""check_model_paths.py - every 3D model path in a board survives a checkout
move (P8 verify suite).

The hit: eleven boards in the boards repo name their footprints' models by
absolute path into the track worktree that built them
(`/.../worktrees/boards/<track>/<ws>/lib/aiee.3dshapes/X.wrl`). Once that
worktree is removed the path is dead, STEP export drops the part and a doc's
render shows the USB-C wrong or missing. lib_pull.py now writes
${KIPRJMOD}-relative paths; this check catches every board made before that,
and anything else that bakes a path in.

A model path passes when it is
  ${KICAD<n>_3DMODEL_DIR}/...   the stock KiCad library, or
  ${KIPRJMOD}/...               relative to the board's dir and staying inside
                                the board's workspace (state.json above it;
                                without one, the dir holding lib/).
Anything else is an error, one finding per distinct path (refs = every
footprint that uses it, pos = the first one), kind:
  model_path_absolute           /home/.., C:/.., \\\\host\\..
  model_path_outside_workspace  ${KIPRJMOD}/ climbing out of the workspace
  model_path_unanchored         a bare relative path, or any other ${VAR}
Whether the file exists today does not matter: a path into a live worktree
resolves until the day that worktree goes. A path whose file is missing is
render's concern (kc.model_audit), not this check's.

--fix rewrites each failing path whose file the workspace's own
lib/*.3dshapes holds, by name, to ${KIPRJMOD}/<rel>/lib/<x>.3dshapes/<name>,
in the board and in the workspace's lib/*.pretty footprints (so the next
footprint update does not bring the old path back). It uses the name lookup
render's relink uses (kc.model_libs / kc.model_lib_file). The report is then
taken on the rewritten board; `fixed` lists what changed. A path with no file
in the lib stays and is still reported.

--fix also keeps the board's passed gates fresh (`restamped` in the report).
Gate freshness hashes the whole board, so the rewrite would otherwise stale
place, drc_routed, verify and dfm although no copper moved. The hash keeps
model paths on purpose: this check runs in the verify suite, so a path edit
by hand must still stale verify. Instead, when the workspace's state.json
records a passed gate against the board exactly as it was before the
rewrite, and the rewrite changed nothing but (model "...") strings, the
gate's recorded board hash moves to the new one (State.restamp_input). The
rewrite can only clear model-path findings, so a gate that passed before
still passes. A gate that was already stale, or failed, stays as it was.
The board is read once and fixed under its writer lock (the one the SWIG
workers take), so the hash the gates move from is of the text the rewrite
started from. If state.json changed meanwhile, its save refuses and the
report says so under `restamped.skipped`; the board stays fixed.

CLI: --pcb board.kicad_pcb [--fix] [--out report.json]
     exit 0 pass / 1 violations / 2 error, per SPEC section 6.
