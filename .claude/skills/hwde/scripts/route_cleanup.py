"""route_cleanup - post-route hygiene: dangling copper, loops, off-angle snap,
90-deg corners (S11, SPEC P7.4).

Runs AFTER route_auto / stitch_vias / plane_repair and BEFORE the drc_routed
gate. Four ordered passes, each a pure analysis over the parsed board that
emits route_edit ops:

  1. DANGLING: iteratively (fixpoint, cap 20) remove track segments and vias
     with a free end - an endpoint touching NO other same-net item (segment,
     via, pad copper, or same-net zone fill on that layer). "Touches" is
     COPPER-BODY overlap, not centerline proximity (T6/V13 root cause: two
     VBUS stubs ending 1.0 mm from a 3.0 mm trunk's centerline sit 0.5 mm
     INSIDE its copper - KiCad-connected, DRC 0 unconnected - and the old
     centerline test called them free and cut the net). On a DRC-clean board
     real gaps keep centerline distance >= (w1+w2)/2 + clearance, so the
     widened test cannot join across a legal gap.
     A free end INSIDE same-net fill is a legal pour termination (kept); a via
     is kept when it joins 2+ same-net items or sits in same-net fill on any
     layer it spans. Our own graph analysis is the source of truth; DRC's
     track_dangling/via_dangling warnings are reported as a cross-check only.
  2. LOOPS: per net, graph of rounded endpoints (vias merge nodes across their
     spanned layers); cycles made ONLY of track segments lose their single
     longest segment (connectivity preserved); fixpoint, cap 10. Paths through
     zone fill or pad copper never form edges, so parallel drops to a plane
     are NOT treated as loops. Guard (T6): a victim whose netconn edge is a
     BRIDGE of the net's full copper graph (tracks+vias+pads+zones) is load-
     bearing by definition and is vetoed, never removed. After loop removal
     the dangling sweep re-runs once (a broken loop can orphan a stub).
  3. SNAP (skip with --no-snap): every straight segment check_route_style
     calls off-angle (its own `off_angle` helper) is rerouted between the
     same endpoints on 0/90 and 45-degree legs. A segment is first cut at
     its joints: KiCad joins two items when an anchor of one (track or arc
     end, via centre, pad centre) lies inside the other's copper, so a
     same-net anchor on the segment's centreline, away from its end caps,
     is a joint the legs must pass through. Copper that only overlaps the
     segment, with no anchor on it, is not a joint. Each piece tries the
     two doglegs first (diagonal-first, axis-first), then, only when both
     fail, the two Z routes (axis-45-axis, 45-axis-45), which swing half as
     far off the line. A route is legal when its legs keep width/2 + the
     pair's clearance (max of the two nets' netclass and .kicad_dru
     clearance, never below the board floor) from every foreign track, via,
     pad and drill (a drill - NPTH, pad or via hole - also keeps the board's
     min_hole_clearance, default 0.25 mm), width/2 + the copper-to-edge rule
     from the board edge, and stay out of track keepouts. Where the router
     already left the replaced copper closer than that, a route is also
     legal when it comes no closer to each foreign net than the old copper
     did and still keeps what DRC enforces: an unconditioned .kicad_dru
     clearance rule overrides the netclass in KiCad's DRC. That fallback is
     off when the .kicad_dru has any conditioned or layer-scoped clearance
     rule, since its value then depends on the pair. Legs accepted this run count as foreign copper for the
     next, and a foreign segment already replaced stops blocking (sweeps
     repeat, cap 5). Foreign zone FILL is not an obstacle: the refill after
     apply moves it. Of the legal routes the one that makes the fewest
     needless jogs wins, then the one with more spare clearance
     (diagonal-first on a tie). Then each needless jog that contains a
     snapped leg is merged: its three segments become one straight or
     dogleg between the outer ends, when legal and the net ends with fewer
     jogs (fact `jogs_merged`). Left alone: a piece with no legal route,
     every diff-pair member (check_diffpair.discover_pairs), every net
     named with --keep-net and, with --constraints, every net that
     constraints.json gives intended geometry (diff_pairs members,
     length_match groups, rf entries, high_speed entries with an
     impedance_ohm), since bending one side alone breaks a pair's coupling
     and a matched net's length. Each one left is listed in `off_angle_left` with
     its reason (blocked + the limiting net, or kept_net); check_route_style
     fails verify on it until it is fixed by hand or waived for that net.
  4. CORNERS (skip with --no-smooth): same-net/layer/width segment pairs
     meeting at 88-92 deg with both legs >= 3*width get a 45-deg chamfer:
     both legs shortened by c = min(min_leg/3, 2*width, 1.0 mm) plus the
     connecting diagonal - only when the diagonal's corridor (width/2 +
     0.2 mm) is clear of foreign copper and of pad copper of ANY net, and the
     corner is not at a pad center/via (0.05 mm) or near other attachments.
     Segments the snap pass replaced are not chamfered.

--snap-only runs pass 3 alone (no dangling/loop/corner edits). It is the
routing stage's mandatory step after plane_repair; the full cleanup stays
optional.

The full op list is generated from the parse BEFORE anything is applied
(--dry-run stops there and needs no toolchain). Otherwise: DRC before,
route_edit.apply_ops (atomic), zone refill iff an op touched a layer carrying
fill, DRC after. There is no rollback after apply: if connectivity degraded
(unconnected_items grew) or new DRC errors appeared, the report says so
LOUDLY (violation kind "cleanup_regression", exit 1) - the orchestrator can
git-restore the board.
