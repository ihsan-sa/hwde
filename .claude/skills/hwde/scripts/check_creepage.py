"""check_creepage.py - same-layer clearance for high-voltage nets (SPEC 6.3, P8).

One concern: IPC-2221 electrical conductor spacing. For every net pair sitting
more than 30 V apart - derived from constraints.json `voltages`, or declared
explicitly via `voltage_pairs` - every same-layer copper item pair (track
segment, via, pad, zone fill) must meet the IPC-2221 Table 6-1 clearance for
that voltage difference, with the table ROW adjudicated per item type and the
board's coating (see T2; LEARNINGS 2026-07-29 check_creepage entries).

Row adjudication (IPC-2221 6.3.4 - exposed lands do NOT fall back to B2):
    inner layer item                    -> B1 (always)
    outer, coating none:  track/via/zone-> B2   pad -> A6
    outer, soldermask:    track/via/zone-> B4   pad -> A6 (mask relief exposes lands)
    outer, conformal:     track/via/zone-> A5   pad -> A7
Pair requirement = max(row(item_a), row(item_b)). Every violating item pair is
reported (not just the worst per net pair - LEARNINGS 2026-07-29: worst-only
hid 216 siblings), spatially deduped at 0.1 mm and capped at 500 per
(net pair, layer).

Waiver class (T6, follows check_return_path's precedent): a violating PAD pair
whose two pads belong to ONE footprint is the vendor land pattern - unfixable
at layout (the P8 lumina-carrier digest hand-adjudicated exactly this class:
"0.200 mm is the inter-lead gap of the SOIC-8 that TI ships"). Emitted at
severity "warning" with waiver_class="land_pattern_pitch" and
same_footprint=true - never silently dropped; part-selection (P3) scope.

Board-rule class (the board's own .kicad_dru, read from the .kicad_pcb's
stem sibling the way kicad-cli loads it): a custom clearance rule scoped to
ONE footprint - e.g. `(condition "A.intersectsCourtyard('U301') &&
B.intersectsCourtyard('U301')")` - says the owner accepts that package's
rating for copper at its own pins (a 0.5 mm-pitch gate driver whose
switch-node pin sits 0.3 mm from its grounded pad). A violating item pair
is demoted to severity "warning" with waiver_class="dru_footprint_scope",
dru_rule and scope_ref - again never dropped - only when ALL of these hold:
  - the rule is a `clearance` rule with no (layer ...) clause, and its
    condition is nothing but `&&`-joined A./B. insideCourtyard,
    intersectsCourtyard, intersectsFrontCourtyard, intersectsBackCourtyard
    or memberOfFootprint terms naming one literal reference. Any other term
    (net names, ||, !, wildcards) makes the rule unreadable here, so it is
    not honoured and the IPC verdict stands;
  - one item is a pad of that footprint, and the other is that
    footprint's pad or a track, via or zone - never another footprint's
    pad, so part-to-part spacing keeps the full IPC requirement;
  - for courtyard terms, both ends of the gap lie inside that footprint's
    declared courtyard (a missing courtyard honours nothing); for
    memberOfFootprint on both A and B, both items are its pads;
  - the gap still meets the rule's own minimum.
What the demotion trusts: the owner's statement that the package is rated
for these nets at its own pitch. It does not model KiCad's rule precedence:
a later, differently-conditioned clearance rule that KiCad would apply to the
same pair is not consulted.

The corpus carries no >30 V nets, so this check is clean on all goldens; supply
voltages via constraints.json to exercise it (synthetic HV fixtures are tested).

CLI: --pcb board.kicad_pcb --constraints constraints.json
     [--coating {none,soldermask,conformal}] [--out report.json]
     exit 0/1/2 per SPEC section 6.

constraints.json inputs:
    {"voltages": [{"net": "HV+", "voltage": 400}, ...],
     "voltage_pairs": [{"a": "/TAP_A1", "b": "/TAP_A2", "voltage": 114}, ...],
     "coating": "none" | "soldermask" | "conformal"}
Nets not listed in `voltages` are treated as 0 V. `voltage_pairs` declares a
DIFFERENTIAL requirement between two named nets regardless of their node
voltages (a bridge/AC input that node voltages cannot express); an explicit
pair overrides the `voltages`-derived difference for that net pair - INCLUDING
a pair declared <= 30 V, which WAIVES the derived check for that pair (the
waiver is recorded in skipped_low_voltage_pairs).
`--coating` overrides the constraints key; default "none".
