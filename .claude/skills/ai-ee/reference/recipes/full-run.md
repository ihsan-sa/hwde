# full-run - brief to order-ready package

The whole pipeline is one recipe. Its steps are the phases; its gates are the
gate table in SKILL.md; the fix loop, the checkpoint format and the spawn
template are shared with every other verb and stay there. Every gate step is
ONE form - `gate.py --gate <g> <input> --workspace <ws> --out <report>` - run on
every attempt, pass and fail: `--workspace` RECORDS the result, and `set-phase`
refuses to advance past a gate phase with no recorded result.

Phase digest: after each phase write 5-10 lines to `log/P<n>-digest.md` and
`state.py set-phase`. Agent selection: spawn only what the design's domains
need - an RF board gets an RF-interface researcher and RF review emphasis; a
USB-C dev board gets neither. Role prompts live in `agents/`; each states its
own scripts and contract.
Lean amendment (S14-proven): purely script-driven phases run INLINE (P5 board
setup, gates, P9 fab/dfm scripts, P10 quote/submit) - rule 1 still holds (read
script JSON, never design files). Judgment roles stay agents; reviewers stay
FRESH-context agents always. Small boards may use ONE schematic agent (record it).

## The phases

- **P0 Intake**: spawn `requirements-analyst`; OPEN questions go to the user in
  ONE batch; lint the artifact with `check_requirements.py`. A brief opening
  with a mode token (`reference/build-modes.md`) is a scope contract: record it
  with `state.py decision`, pass it to P2 + every reviewer spawn. Safety
  unknowns (mains / battery / >3 A) are never guessed - an unattended run
  records delegate answers as PROVISIONAL decisions, re-confirmed at H1.
- **P1 Research** (parallel): from the requirements pick the roster -
  `research-component-scout` (per major function), `research-reference-design`
  (per novel block), `research-interface-spec` (per standards-bound interface),
  `research-power-architect` (always, unless trivially powered). Summaries only.
- **P2 Architecture**: spawn `architect`; record its decisions (`state.py
  decision`). **P2 exit = coverage (U13)**:
  `knowledge.py --coverage --workspace <ws> --phase P2 --out log/coverage-P2.json`
  (blocks[] carry `operating_point`; an undeclared dim keeps a record
  `provisional`). On a `mapping_request` spawn `coverage-mapper` (schema-forced
  record->slot->class edges, no verdicts), re-run with `--mapping <its file>`
  (sha logged in the report). Exit 1 = gap slots = research launches
  AUTOMATICALLY (owner ruling; the `research` recipe carries the mechanics):
  `research.py open --workspace <ws> --gaps log/coverage-P2.json --all --phase P2`
  (one task per gap inside `budgets.research`; `status: checkpoint` = cap
  spent - present the unopened slots at H1), per task `researcher` -> FRESH
  `research-second-reader` -> `research.py close`, then re-run coverage
  (verified records fold in as `provisional`). A slot still `gap` is a
  `state.py decision` "designing under coverage gap: ...", never silence. **H1**
  (blocking): blocks, stackup, cost ballpark, key parts, riskiest decision,
  coverage summary (covered / provisional / gap per slot), cap state.
- **P3 Parts + Library**: spawn `part-sourcer`; `datasheet-extractor` per
  nontrivial IC (parallel) - reuse a prior board's `parts/<lcsc>.json` on LCSC
  match (re-run `--validate`); then `librarian`. Pad-geometry failures block P4.
  Per-part detail: the `make-footprint` recipe. **P3 exit = coverage again**
  (`--phase P3`): part slots join - per IC, extraction `layout_notes`
  thin/empty = gap; same mapper + auto-research protocol (part-level records
  from the vendor's layout section / app note).
- **P4 Schematic**: one `schematic-block` per sheet from
  `architecture/sheets.md` (parallel where independent; the root-sheet agent
  stitches, runs ERC and `netlist_audit`). Gate `erc`. Then `schematic-reviewer`
  (fresh context): errors -> fix loop, warnings -> `reports/erc-waivers.md`.
  **H2** (blocking): schematic PDF + reviewer findings + waivers.
- **P5 Board Setup**: inline (`board_init` then `rules_gen`, per
  `agents/board-setup.md`); spawn `board-setup` only for impedance or
  library-repair boards. Parity 0, setup 0; sidecars beside the board.
- **P6 Placement**: spawn `placement` (seed -> anneal -> select/repair, <= 8 edit
  iterations). Gate `place`. **H3** (optional, default ON): top/bottom render.
  Silk/refdes collisions are scripted fixes (`silk_place`, `move_text`); agents
  verify with a full kicad-cli DRC - never trust one checker.
- **P7 Routing**: spawn `router` (chain order is board-class dependent - its
  prompt carries the verified 2L/4L orders). Gate `drc_routed`. A
  `placement_adjust_request` takes the SANCTIONED backward edge: snapshot,
  re-spawn `placement` scoped to the request's refs/region, re-run P7
  (`freerouting_retries` guards the loop).
- **P8 Verification**: run the `verify` gate (all 8 checks), then
  `verify-reviewer` (fresh context) with the summary + renders. Triage:
  script-check errors -> fix loop; reviewer errors -> fix loop or human;
  warnings -> `reports/verify-waivers.json` (re-gate with it). After ANY
  copper/placement fix re-run `drc_routed` BEFORE `verify`. **H4** (blocking):
  verification summary + annotated renders + waivers.
- **P9 DFM**: the `dfm-check` recipe, inline (`dfm` agent only for narrative).
- **P10 Ordering**: the `order` recipe, including H5 and the creation latch.

## Simulation legs

- P2/P4: for boards with nontrivial analog content spawn `sim-analyst` - it
  authors `kicad/sims/*.cir` + `.bounds.json` (generic model cards from
  datasheet parameters + Tier-B pin stimulus; NO vendored vendor models). Gate
  `sim` at P8 (`gate.py --gate sim kicad/sims --workspace <ws>`): every bench
  needs a bounds sidecar (missing OR empty = error by design). Wrong-value
  defects - the class no other gate sees - fail here.
- P8 layout legs, advisory by default: `check_irdrop.py` (2.5D FDM IR drop +
  current density on the real copper; gates only when `irdrop_mv_max` /
  `jmax_a_per_mm` are declared; honor `grid_unconverged` warnings) and
  `check_pdn_z.py --metadata decoupling.json` (plane-cavity |Z|; judge peaks and
  `first_min` - `z_max` is a band-edge model artifact; `pdn_target_mohm` gates
  antiresonance peaks only). Fold both into the P8 review; never block on them
  without constraints-declared bounds.

## Run close, and bring-up close

Before the run is declared finished: append what this board taught to
`boards/<b>/LEARNINGS.md` (dated, stage-tagged, one claim per heading), then
`learnings.py compile --workspace boards/<b>`. Compiling is not promoting: the
entries stay `pending` until a `promote` pass rules on each one (that recipe
carries the ladder). Do it at the END of the run - an entry's value is often
only clear two phases later. Bring-up close (T11): `state.py log --event
bringup_passed`, then `knowledge.py --prove --workspace boards/<b>` (`--dry-run`
first) - every record that APPLIED becomes `proven` with its evidence entry.

## Resuming, and editing mid-run

A killed run resumes through `resume-phase`. A change of mind mid-run is not a
rewind: after P5, `add-part` / `swap-part` / `remove-part` preserve placement
and routing. Get decoupling and protection into the schematic before P5 anyway.

## Do not

- Do not run phases you have gate evidence for. `resume-phase` reads freshness;
  a passed-and-fresh gate is not re-run.
- Do not let a report gate the run. `report_gen.py` is non-blocking by contract:
  on exit 1/2 log `report_gen_degraded`, point at the .tex or the last good PDF,
  and continue.
