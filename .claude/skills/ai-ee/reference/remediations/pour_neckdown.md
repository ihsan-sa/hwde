# pour_neckdown

A zone FILL on a power net pinches below the IPC-2152 width for the rail's budget somewhere
between its via attachment points: eroding the fill by required/2 splits the vias into separate
components (polygon-erosion equivalent of a medial-axis min-width). A trunk neck throttles the
whole rail even when every track passes.

- Emitted by: scripts/check_current.py (kind="pour_neckdown")   Gate: verify (P8, via verify_all.py)
- Fixer domain: router (cluster_violations.py)   Scripts you may use: route_edit.py, kc.py, render.py, stitch_vias.py, route_cleanup.py
- Fields: pos (a representative point of the SPLIT, not the whole neck), layer, net, neck_mm,
  required_mm, current_a. Severity: error for a declared power entry - plane_fed does NOT downgrade
  it (a trunk neck is real); WARNING with `derived: true` when the entry was synthesized return-net
  coverage (T6: the budget is then a heuristic, max of the declared rails).

## Is it real?
- Check `current_a` first. An override region covering the reported pos re-tests the fill at the
  override current; a declared regulator-feed region that should cover it but does not is an input
  fix, not a copper fix. On a `derived: true` finding the budget is the LARGEST declared rail - the
  return may legitimately spread over parallel paths; judge the geometry before spending copper.
- The neck position is a sample: the fill was eroded until the via set split, and pos is a
  representative point of one component. Render the layer and find the actual pinch (foreign-pad
  antipads and keepout channels are the usual cause) before editing.
- A pour that necks around a fine-pitch connector is usually the fan-in geometry problem: on
  pd-trigger NO legal 1.75 mm VBUS track could reach the USB-C pads at all - the pour IS the fix
  there, and its neck width is what the pad column allows (LEARNINGS 2026-07-28 line 782).
- The 5 A return class (LEARNINGS 2026-07-28 line 832): autorouted GND contact-pad attachments are
  0.2 mm tracks (0.80 A) and one via per pad - the pour lobe repair below is the proven fix.

## Fix ladder (cheapest first)
1. Confirm the input: `checked[]` entry (current_a, dt_c, required_mm_by_layer) vs the
   board-directory constraints.json; `stackup_assumed: true` means the copper weights are
   defaults - fix the stackup block, not the board.
2. Widen the pinch in place: grow the zone polygon (planes_gen sidecar region) or clear the
   obstruction (move a via/track crowding the channel via route_edit.py remove + re-add).
   Refill and re-check: `kc.py drc --refill --save-board` then check_current.py.
3. Pinch caused by foreign pads that cannot move: add a SECOND lobe/zone spanning the neck at a
   distinct priority (planes_gen planes-only sidecar; priority 1 makes the neighbouring pour
   yield; cross-net overlap at distinct priorities is legal - LEARNINGS 2026-07-28 line 832).
   Solid pad connects for high-current pads: the zone must not thermal-relief a 2.5 A pad.
4. Neck is load-bearing but the budget is wrong (parallel return paths, transient-only worst
   case): escalate for an `overrides` region or a corrected current_a in constraints.json -
   constraints are not a router file; put the measured neck width in OPEN.
5. Escalate `requires_pipeline_rewind` when the fix needs new outer-layer copper on a board
   whose escapes are shorter than the via pitch: it cannot be retrofitted at P8
   (LEARNINGS 2026-07-29 line 1588 - 26 of 44 clusters had ZERO feasible positions).

## Do not
- Do not bridge the neck with a rule-width TRACK through the same channel: the DRU width floor
  that applies to tracks is why the pour was used; a zone is width-rule-exempt, a track is not
  (LEARNINGS 2026-07-28 line 782).
- Do not waive a plane_fed pour neck as "advisory like the rest": plane_fed downgrades via
  clusters and segments only - the pour IS the declared trunk, its neck carries the rail.
- Do not refill by hand-editing fill polygons; only `kc.py drc --refill --save-board` writes
  fills the toolchain accepts.
- Do not trust `gate place` or check_decoupling after editing copper - only DRC sees routed
  copper (LEARNINGS 2026-07-29 line 1470).
