"""place_swig - BUNDLED-python SWIG worker for place_edit.py (S9).

Runs inside KiCad's bundled python (the only interpreter with pcbnew); invoked
as `python place_swig.py job.json` by the venv driver. stdlib only.

job JSON: {"board": in_path, "out": out_path, "ops": [op, ...]}
ops are ABSOLUTE (idempotent by construction - re-applying is a no-op):
  {"op": "place",  "ref": R, "x": mm, "y": mm, ["deg": d], ["side": front|back]}
  {"op": "move",   "ref": R, "x": mm, "y": mm}
  {"op": "rotate", "ref": R, "deg": d}
  {"op": "flip",   "ref": R, "side": "front"|"back"}   # absolute side, not toggle
  {"op": "lock",   "ref": R, "locked": true|false}
Text ops (S14, closes V17 - silk labels/refdes moves were previously
unscriptable):
  {"op": "add_text",  "text": T, "x": mm, "y": mm, "layer": "F.SilkS",
   ["deg": d], ["size": mm], ["thickness": mm]}
     - board-frame graphic text. Idempotent: an existing text with the same
       string on the same layer within 0.01 mm is UPDATED, never duplicated.
  {"op": "remove_text", "text": T, "x": mm, "y": mm, "layer": "F.SilkS"}
     - deletes the board-frame graphic text matching (string, layer, position
       within 0.01 mm).  Idempotent: absent -> no-op, {"removed": 0}.  This is
       the only scripted way to RELOCATE a gr_text (remove + add_text), which
       a mismarked polarity/cathode legend needs.
  {"op": "move_text", "ref": R, "field": "reference"|"value", "x": mm,
   "y": mm, ["deg": d]}
     - repositions a footprint's Reference/Value field text (board frame;
       stored angle is ABSOLUTE per LEARNINGS [geometry]).
  {"op": "silk_clear", "ref": R, ["layer": "F.SilkS"], ["only_offboard": true]}
     - deletes a footprint's own GRAPHIC silk (lines/arcs/circles/polys) on
       that layer, never its Reference/Value text. `only_offboard` keeps the
       items fully inside the board outline. The only scripted way to fix
       footprint-INTERNAL silk on an already-placed board (a library edit
       cannot reach one without re-running board_init and losing placement).

The board is saved ONLY if every op applied; any failure exits 3 with a JSON
error and writes nothing (the driver treats the staged copy as garbage).
Save() may drop a default .kicad_pro next to `out` - the driver stages in a
scratch dir and moves only the .kicad_pcb back, so real project files are
never clobbered. mm->IU uses pcbIUScale.mmToIU (FromMM truncates: prior-
attempt fact, e.g. 32.3 mm -> 32299999 nm).

#     part happened to have when the op ran, and the same {x,y,deg,side} op
#     would then produce different geometry on different boards.
#   TOP_BOTTOM mirrors local y and negates the orientation, independent of the
#     starting angle; SetOrientationDegrees below then pins the angle, so the
#     op fully determines the result. placelib.Footprint.mirror models THIS.

    Delete a footprint's own GRAPHIC silk items (lines, arcs, circles, polys).
    Reference/Value text is never touched - move those with move_text.

    Why this exists: footprint-INTERNAL silk is the librarian's to fix in the
    LIBRARY, but a library edit does not reach a board that is already placed,
    and nothing else in this pipeline can edit footprint graphics on a board.
    That mattered on g0-sense P6: 12 of 13 residual silk warnings were body
    outlines (a 0603 wedged between two ICs, and a flush edge connector whose
    mouth-end silk hangs off the board), and `drc_routed` fails at
    errors+warnings = 0, so they had to go before P7 could pass. Re-running
    board_init to pick up a library edit would have destroyed the placement.

    `only_offboard` keeps every item whose bounding box lies inside the board
    outline and deletes the rest - the flush-connector case, where the silk
    that offends is the part hanging past the edge and the rest is worth
    keeping. Without it the footprint's graphic silk goes entirely.

    Idempotent: nothing left to delete is a no-op with {"removed": 0}."""
