"""netconn.py - per-net copper connectivity graph (tracks + vias + pads + zones).

Provenance: LEARNINGS.md 2026-07-29 [check_diffpair][gates]. An endpoint-snap-
only track graph ignores vias and pad copper, so sub-0.3 mm endpoint mismatches
(machine-measured 0.1414 / 0.2229 / 0.2530 mm on lumina-carrier's MDI pairs)
split a net into components and silently turn "trunk skew" into total-copper-
length. Joined here per the machine-verified KiCad connectivity rules
(LEARNINGS 2026-07-30 [kicad][connectivity]): an endpoint landing inside a VIA
or PAD is connected; two overlapping same-layer round END CAPS are connected
(DRC and netlist were clean on all three lumina cases); an endpoint inside
another track's BODY is NOT connected and is deliberately not joined here.

Shared by check_diffpair (trunk/skew) and check_current (bridge = cut-edge
detection, LEARNINGS 2026-07-29 [check_current][gates] "no bridge awareness").

Node ids (hashable tuples):
    ("pt", (x, y))         track endpoint snapped to `snap` decimals
    ("via", i)             i-th via of the net (bg.vias_of(net) order)
    ("pad", ref, number)   a Pad's copper
    ("zone", j)            j-th zone-fill polygon (include_zones=True only)

Edges: every track segment contributes one edge (edge_id = its index in
bg.tracks_of(net), recorded in NetGraph.tracks); join edges carry distinct
("join", k) ids so bridge finding can tell parallel edges apart, and are
absent from NetGraph.tracks - bridge_tracks() reports SEGMENT edges only.
