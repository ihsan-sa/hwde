"""stitch_vias - stitching vias + via fences for plane hygiene (S11, SPEC P7.4).

Three jobs (SPEC P7.4: "GND stitching at rise-time-derived pitch"):

1. PAD STITCHING (default): every SMD pad of a target net whose layer does
   NOT carry that net's plane gets a through via tying it to the plane.
   Candidates form a small ring just past the pad edge (on-pad vias short
   neighbours at fine pitch - prior-attempt fact; 0.65 mm from pad centre
   verified safe), tried away-from-body first. A spot whose via disc misses
   the pad's own copper gets a short connecting track (corridor clearance-
   checked against foreign copper too). A pad with no clear spot is SKIPPED
   with a note, never forced. Pads already within 0.2 mm of a same-net via
   are skipped as already stitched. THT/NPTH pads are never stitched (their
   barrel reaches every layer; a co-located via trips hole_to_hole).
2. AREA STITCHING: extra same-net vias on a pitch grid across the net's
   plane fill - grid points inside the fill, >= 1 mm from the board edge,
   outside rule-area keepouts, >= pitch/2 from existing same-net vias, and
   bonding same-net copper on >= 2 copper layers (a via reaching only one
   plane is useless copper and a KiCad via_dangling warning - S11-verified
   live). --pitch auto derives the pitch from the fastest t_rise_ns among
   constraints["high_speed"] (see rise_pitch_mm), clamped to [2, 15] mm.
3. VIA FENCE (--fence-net NET): rows of GND vias flanking every routed track
   of NET, sampled at --fence-pitch (default: rise-time pitch clamped to
   [1, 10] mm), offset perpendicular on BOTH sides by --fence-offset
   (default 2 x track width + 0.3 mm). Used by route_critical for RF nets.

Every candidate must clear FOREIGN copper (any net != target) on ALL copper
layers a through via spans (via disc grown by the board clearance) and keep
>= 0.5 mm centre distance to every known drill (vias + THT barrels). When
stitching several nets, power nets go first and GND always last (prior-
attempt fact: GND candidates are numerous and box power pads out otherwise).

Contract (SPEC section 6):
  stitch_vias.py --pcb B.kicad_pcb [--constraints c.json] [--nets GND[,+3V3]]
      [--pitch MM|auto] [--max-vias N] [--via-size MM] [--via-drill MM]
      [--clearance MM] [--dry-run] [--strict] [--out-report r.json]
      [--fence-net NET [--fence-offset MM] [--fence-pitch MM]]
  Payload: {mode, requested, placed, skipped: [{ref|at, reason}], pitch_mm,
      fence_net?, nets: {...per-net facts...}, ops: [...]}. A net with no
      plane fill is reported and skipped (not an error). If >= 1 pad needed
      stitching for a net and NONE could be placed -> violation kind
      "stitch_impossible" (severity warning): exit 1 only with --strict,
      otherwise status stays "pass" with the violation listed as advisory.
  Writes go through route_edit.apply_ops (atomic + verified + idempotent);
  after an apply on a board with pours, zones are refilled via
  `kicad-cli pcb drc --refill-zones --save-board` (kc.run_drc). --dry-run
  only emits the ops list + report and never touches the board.

Determinism: pads iterate sorted by (ref, pad number), grid points by
(x, y), fence samples along sorted tracks; no RNG - identical inputs give a
byte-identical ops list.
