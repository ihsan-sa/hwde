"""gate.py - evaluate a pipeline gate (SPEC.md sections 3-4).

    gate.py --gate <name> <input.kicad_sch|.kicad_pcb> [--workspace DIR]
            [--out FILE] [--commit MSG]
    gate.py --gate <name> --report <kc-report.json>          (evaluate, don't re-run)
    gate.py --list

A gate (defined in reference/gates.yaml) runs a kc.py report on an artifact and
applies pass criteria: it FAILS when the count of violations whose severity is
in the gate's fail_severities exceeds max_count. On pass, --commit MSG git-adds
and commits the repo (SPEC section 4: "Git commit after every gate pass"); it
never commits on failure and never pushes.

JSON to stdout (or --out): {script, gate, status:pass|fail, counts, criteria,
failing:[violations that triggered], record_result, commit_result?}. Exit
0 = pass, 1 = fail, 2 = error (bad gate name, toolchain, unreadable input, or
a requested record/commit that did not happen).

T6 additions:
 - --commit stages the board WORKSPACE only (boards/<name>/, derived from the
   input path), never `git add -A` at repo root - a parallel session's dirty
   files no longer ride along in gate commits (LEARNINGS 2026-07-27). Dirty
   paths outside the workspace are listed in commit_result.excluded_dirty.
 - drc gates with drc_options.require_fresh_fills (drc_routed) refuse a
   stale-fill board with exit 2 instead of grading ~375 phantom zone
   clearance errors (LEARNINGS 2026-07-29, hand-run KRT board).
 - --waivers FILE (default <input dir>/reports/verify-waivers.json for the
   verify gate): human-approved residual findings; each waiver needs
   non-empty `reason` and `approved` and matches on (check|kind) + net
   (+ refs subset). Waived violations do not count toward failure but are
   echoed in the result as `waived`.

U2 additions (codex C4):
 - --report is VALIDATED, never trusted: schema version, producing-script
   identity vs the gate's tool, successful status, a present `violations`
   list (a missing key is invalid, not empty), recorded input path (must
   exist, and match the positional input when given), input digest
   (statelib normalized-hash norms) against the file on disk, and a
   generation-time staleness bound (--max-report-age-h, default 24).
   Anything malformed/stale/mismatched -> exit 2, never a pass.
 - --commit requires an explicit board scope: the input must resolve to a
   boards/<name>/ workspace. The repo-wide `git add -A` fallback is gone;
   pre-staged index entries outside the scope refuse the commit. A
   requested commit that does not occur (other than a clean nothing-to-do
   skip) is an OPERATIONAL error: the process exits 2 even on gate pass.
 - gates may set `strict: true` (release contexts, gates.yaml
   verify_release/dfm_release): the tool runs in strict coverage mode -
   every applicable check must run, a missing input is a coverage failure
   (codex C7), and the gate refuses (exit 2) instead of grading a partial
   report.

U5 additions (codex H9 - durable waivers):
 - waiver matching hardened: a refs-scoped waiver never matches a refs-less
   finding (the empty set was a subset of everything); a waiver may carry
   `pos` [x, y] and then only matches findings within 0.01 mm of it.
 - waiver entries may carry durability bindings - `artifact` (the report's
   input_digest they were approved against), `checker_version` (checklib
   stamp) and `expires` (ISO date). When present they are validated against
   the report; a waiver whose binding no longer holds matches NOTHING and
   is surfaced in the result as `waivers_invalid`.
 - strict gates REQUIRE full durability on every waiver entry (exit 2
   otherwise) - release waivers are evidence, not conveniences.
 - the default verify sidecar resolution now also checks the board
   WORKSPACE reports/ dir (releaselib.waivers_for_input; LEARNINGS
   2026-08-08 - a waiver file in the obvious place was silently ignored).

U16 additions (the bb-buck defect - running a gate and recording it were two
steps and only the first was enforced, so a board reached P9 with six passing
gate reports on disk and `gates: {}` in state.json):
 - the gate RECORDS ITSELF. When the input sits inside a workspace (a
   directory holding a state.json - found by walking the input's parents, or
   named outright with --workspace), the result goes through
   state.record_gate: input hashes, attempt count, stale-mark clearing, and
   the U5 digest tooth all apply. Pass AND fail are recorded (the fix loop
   wants every attempt). Recording happens BEFORE --commit, so the state
   update rides in the gate commit.
 - a golden/mutant corpus input has no workspace: nothing is recorded, the
   result says so (`record_result.recorded: false` + reason) and the exit
   code is unchanged. --no-record opts out explicitly.
 - a REQUESTED-but-failed record is an operational error (exit 2), exactly
   like a requested-but-failed commit: a caller keying on exit 0 must not
   believe the evidence was preserved when it was not.
