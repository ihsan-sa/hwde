"""state.py - state.json read/write helpers for the /ai-ee orchestrator (SPEC 4, S13).

state.json is the single source of truth for one design run. The orchestrator
NEVER carries pipeline state in its context: it reads the resume summary, acts,
and records every transition here. Every mutating subcommand appends a
timestamped event to `history`, so the file is both current state AND audit
trail (`a killed-and-resumed session continues from the last gate`).

    }
    mark = {ts, edit_class, refs, human_hold} - stamped by `edit` from
    reference/invalidation.yaml, cleared by record-gate (gates) / re-register
    (artifacts). A gate is FRESH iff its recorded input hashes all match the
    current normalized hashes AND it carries no mark (lib/statelib.py; the
    two-layer semantics are documented in invalidation.yaml).

CLI (spec 6 contract: argparse, JSON to stdout, exit 0 ok / 2 error; state.py
has no violation concept so exit 1 is unused):
    state.py init --workspace DIR --board NAME [--phase P0] [--force]
    state.py show|resume|freshness [--workspace DIR | --state FILE]
    state.py set-phase --phase P7 [--force] ...
    state.py record-gate --gate NAME --result gate_result.json [--phase PN] ...
    state.py artifact --name pcb --path kicad/b.kicad_pcb ...
    state.py edit --class move_fp [--refs U1 U2] [--note TEXT] ...
    state.py rehash [--names gerbers bom] ...
    state.py spawn --role fixer --model opus [--effort high] [--tokens N] ...
    state.py decision --what W --why Y ...
    state.py human --checkpoint 2 --status approved [--note N] ...
    state.py issue --id 3 --status fixed [--agent fixer-1] [--bump-attempts] ...
    state.py budget --path fix_loops.drc_routed [--consume] ...
    state.py log --event name [--data JSON] ...
    state.py snapshot --label L [--files F ...] / restore --label L ...

`set-phase` REFUSES to advance past a gate phase whose gate has no recorded
result (U16 - bb-buck reached P9 with six passing gate reports on disk and
`gates: {}` in state). `gate.py --workspace <ws>` records the result itself, so
the normal flow never sees the refusal; `--force` is the escape hatch and logs
`phase_forced` with the missing gates.

CLI `log` event names are machine keys: ^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$ (XC-8: a live
run stored paragraphs as event names; prose belongs in --data {"msg": ...}).
`log --event spawn --data {...}` additionally appends the data to the
first-class `spawns` ledger (the SKILL.md step-5 form keeps working).

Writes are atomic (tmp file + os.replace, same directory). Single-writer by
design: the orchestrator serializes all state mutations (SPEC 4 concurrency).
Snapshot labels/dirs are STABLE interfaces - bench fixture provenance points
at state_snapshots/<label> paths (T5).
