"""order_submit.py - order manifest, API quote, and SAFETY-GATED create (P10).

SPEC P10 is explicit: "Payment/final submission is always human." The default
flow therefore never spends money. It:

  1. verifies the fab package is present and internally consistent (gerber zip,
     BOM, CPL) and hashes every artefact,
  2. snapshots the board spec + the chosen quote row,
  3. writes fab/order.json - the traceability record (SPEC P10: order number,
     spec snapshot, gerber hash). The workspace's fab/order.json is ALWAYS
     the record of truth: it is read for prior state and written on every
     run regardless of --out (--out merely adds a copy of the payload
     elsewhere). A rebuild DEEP-MERGES the existing api block (esp.
     api.order) and preserves prior non-generated human_steps (the
     "BOARD-SPECIFIC ..." class survives verbatim forever), so a re-run
     never clobbers a placed-order record or hand-written order notes,
  4. emits the manual-submission deep links, including the JLCDFM upload step
     (V6: JLCDFM has no public API - that second opinion is semi-manual by
     design), and the exact human actions left.

JLCPCB Open API legs (lib/jlcapi.py; contract researched in
ai-library/jlcpcb-openapi-2026/contract.md; pcbParam per the hendley
api-reference PcbOrderCraftData table, the contract's [SDK/PDF] source):

  --api         QUOTE-ONLY: uploadGerber -> audit/get -> calculate, with
                pcbParam built from the spec snapshot + quote spec + the
                stackup-derived copper weight (architecture/stackup.md
                `## Chosen:` id, e.g. JLC2313_1.6_2oz -> "2"). Writes
                fab/api_quote.json (REAL price vs our estimate, shipList,
                achieveDateList, audit findings, the quoted gerber sha256)
                and records the verdict in order.json's api block. NEVER
                calls create. HTTP 403 means the service scope is still under
                review - that is a REPORTED outcome (verdict scope_pending,
                exit 0), not an error: it proves the signing works.

  --api-create  !!! REAL MONEY !!! The ONLY code path that calls pcb/create.
                JLCPCB has NO sandbox or test mode: a successful create places
                a real factory order, and payment mechanics are UNVERIFIED -
                the platform may auto-deduct the prepaid JLC Balance. Guards:
                  * LAYER GUARD: 4+ layer boards refuse outright - JLC's own
                    create returns an unclassifiable code 2 for them and
                    offers no way to ask whether an ambiguous create landed;
                    4L ordering is the web-cart path (see agents/ordering.md),
                  * created-latch: refuses when the CANONICAL fab/order.json
                    already records ANY order - api.order ids, a "created"
                    verdict, or a WEB order_number recorded via
                    --order-number - --out cannot sidestep it (reordering
                    requires manually clearing the record),
                  * ambiguous-attempt block: an api.create_attempt record is
                    pre-armed ON DISK immediately before the transport call;
                    a record left "in_flight" (crash / transport loss
                    mid-create) or "failed:unknown_error"/"failed:error"
                    (JLC answered ambiguously) refuses every later create
                    until a human verifies the portal and manually clears
                    api.create_attempt. Unambiguous rejections
                    (bad_signature/scope_pending/ip_blocked/rate_limited)
                    do not block a retry,
                  * --api-quote-file: a FRESH (<24 h, not future-dated)
                    api_quote.json written by a --api run,
                  * design binding: the current package's NORMALIZED design
                    hash (lib/fabhash.py - export timestamps stripped) must
                    equal the one recorded at quote time. The order still goes
                    out against the quoted fileKey, i.e. the bytes JLC audited;
                    a harmless re-export no longer invalidates the quote, a
                    real copper change still does,
                  * freight attestation: shipping_method must be one of the
                    QUOTED shipList options and its recorded cost must match;
                    the grand total must equal real_price + freight,
                  * qty cross-check: the attested qty must equal the qty the
                    calculate request actually priced (pcbParam.qty),
                  * --confirm "<board> <qty>pcs <grand_total>": grand_total =
                    real_price + selected freight, exactly as recorded in
                    api_quote.json (typo-proof human token - the human proves
                    they read the real all-in quote).
                Optional --ship-json may contain ONLY shippingAddress /
                billingAddress / taxOrVATNumber / billingAddressFlag (any
                other key refuses - quote-binding fields are not overridable).
                shippingMethod comes from the api quote's recorded
                shipping_method (first shipList option - review it in
                api_quote.json before confirming). Tests must NEVER point
                this path at a live transport - mock the session.

Release attestation (U5, codex C1): a fab dir inside a GOVERNED workspace
(state.json beside it) orders through its release attestation or not at
all. The manifest carries a `release` block (release_governance ->
releaselib.verify); a governed workspace whose fab/attestation.json is
missing or invalid gets manifest status `not_order_ready` (exit 1) and the
API legs refuse BEFORE any network call (exit 2). When the attestation is
valid, its manufacturing options are LAW: --copper-oz that contradicts the
attested copper weight refuses instead of waiving (the pd-trigger 1 oz
case), quote-spec mismatches refuse, and --api-create additionally binds
the on-disk package to the ATTESTED design hash. Bare fab dirs with no
state.json stay on the legacy manifest flow (nothing recorded to attest).

CLI:
  order_submit.py --pcb board.kicad_pcb --fab-dir fab/ [--quote quote.json]
                  [--qty 5] [--api] [--api-create --api-quote-file q.json

                  [--order-number N] [--out fab/order.json]
Exit 0 ready-for-human (incl. API verdicts ok / scope_pending / created)
/ 1 package incomplete or not order-ready (governed, attestation
missing/invalid) / 2 error (missing creds, bad signature, IP block, rate
limit, refused confirm/latch/whitelist/binding/attestation, transport
failure).
