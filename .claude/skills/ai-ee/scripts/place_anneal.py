"""place_anneal - simulated-annealing placement refinement (S10, SPEC P6 stage 2).

SA over rigid CLUSTER positions/rotations (clusters = placelib.build_clusters
+ place_seed satellite slots - the same move unit and transform math as the
seed), starting from the board's current placement (normally place_seed
--apply output). The board file is never touched unless --apply-best; results
are emitted as ABSOLUTE op lists for place_edit.py.

Cost (raw term totals maintained incrementally, recombined with weights at
accept time):
  w_hpwl    * sum_net class_weight(net) * hpwl(net)     [gnd 0.25/pwr 0.6/sig 1]
  w_overlap * mm^2 of courtyard overlap + keepout overlap + outside-outline
              (ramped by sqrt(T0/T) so late epochs are effectively legal-only)
  w_cong    * congestion overflow (MST flight-line demand above --cong-cap
              per 2 mm cell; gnd-class nets excluded - they ride planes)
  w_cross   * weighted MST flight-line crossings (pair weight = w(a)*w(b))
  w_rule    * rule terms: high-current path length (current_a * hpwl of each
              constraints.power net), separation groups
              (placement.separation), thermal spreading (constraints.thermal),
              corridor keep-clear (placement.corridors: bodies other than the
              two endpoints pay CORRIDOR_W per mm^2 inside the swath - T6
              P6A-5 cost-only version; seed/legality integration deferred)
  w_assembly* assembly cost of the BACK side (U19): ASM_SECOND_SIDE_MM once
              any part sits there + ASM_PER_PART_MM each, in weighted-HPWL mm

Both sides (U19): _propose() can move a cluster to the OTHER side, so the
annealer can DISCOVER that the back tightens a loop or unjams a packed board
instead of only respecting a side it was handed. A flip mirrors the cluster in
its own frame (placelib.Footprint.mirror is the in-memory pcbnew Flip), so
satellites follow their anchor by construction. Guards: only free clusters
flip - never a declared-edge connector, never a through-hole cluster (back-side
THT is a hand/wave operation this cost model cannot price), never a ref pinned
by constraints placement.sides [{"ref": R, "side": "front"|"back"}]. The
assembly term is the brake that keeps a board which does not NEED two sides
single-sided; --no-side-flips turns the move off entirely.

--margin-mm buffers every body/obstacle poly by margin/2 for the SA overlap
term and repair targets ONLY (true courtyards stay the legality oracle), so
packed-but-legal is accepted but cost-discouraged - the courtyard-margin
answer to silk-blind packing (ladder row 53). Default 0.0 = exact prior
behavior.

Adaptive schedule: T0 from sampled uphill deltas; per-epoch cooling and move
window scaled by the epoch acceptance ratio (TimberWolf-style). Deterministic
per --seed: random.Random(seed) is the only entropy source; wall-clock is
reported but never steers the search.

Top-N: distinct best states are kept during the search; each candidate is
applied to the in-memory model, greedily repaired if it left minor illegality,
legality-checked (placelib), and emitted as cand<k>.ops.json + metrics.

Routability feedback (SPEC P6.2): --route-feedback needs the S11 DSN/
Freerouting path and exits 2 until S11 lands. The blending logic is BUILT and
testable now: anneal(..., route_probe=fn) probes the current best state every
--feedback-every epochs; completion c in [0,1] boosts congestion/crossing
weights by (1 + fb_gain*(1-c)) and candidate scores rank by
cost * (1 + w_feedback*(1-c)). S11 wires the real probe.

Exit 0 best candidate legal / 1 no legal candidate (best one's violations
reported) / 2 error.
