# The firmware manifest (/fwe -> /npie)

/fwe writes `firmware/fwe-manifest.json` next to every build; /npie reads it
to flash the board and drive the firmware. It is the whole interface: /npie
never reads firmware sources, and /fwe never assumes a bench.
`scripts/fw_manifest.py` derives it and `--check` says whether one is stale.

Where each part comes from: connectors and pins from the board's netlist (the
J* part on the MCU's SWD and UART nets, through one series resistor), the
command list from the dispatch in `src/console.c` (one entry per command
the firmware answers, so a later stage's `spin` appears when its console
handles it; `reply_fields` are the top-level keys of its `OK` object, read from
the handler; `args` and `safe` come from a `/* fwe-cmd args="..." safe=yes|no */`
comment on the command's dispatch line, which a stage writes for each command it
adds, else from the script's table of the bringup commands, else `"?"` and
unsafe), `safety` from
`config/fw_config.h` (`pwm_hz` is `PWM_FREQ_HZ`), `stage`/`version` from the build's CMake cache, and the
sha256s from `build/`. `verified` records evidence, not a derivation:
`host_tests` is whether fw_test.py passed when the manifest was written, `sim`
the simulator a smoke test passed in (null when none ran), and `hardware` is
always false because /fwe never touches a bench.
The example below lists three of the eleven bring-up commands.

## UART protocol (line-based ASCII)

- One command per line, `\n`-terminated, lowercase words separated by spaces.
- Every command gets exactly one reply line: `OK <json>` or `ERR <code> <text>`.
  The JSON is a single object on one line so a script can parse it.
- Asynchronous events are lines starting `EVT <json>` (a fault trip, a
  button press); a driver must accept them between a command and its reply.
- Boot prints one banner line matching `banner_regex`, then `EVT {"boot":...}`
  carrying the reset cause.
- Commands a motor board firmware implements at the bringup stage:
  `version`, `status`, `selftest`, `adc` (raw + scaled channels),
  `offsets` (re-run current-sense offset calibration, bridge off),
  `led <status|fault> <on|off|auto>`, `arm` (MOE on, 0 duty), `disarm`,
  `duty <a> <b> <c>` (0..1, refused unless armed and capped by `max_duty`),
  `clear` (clear a latched fault), `reset`.
  Each is listed in `commands` with `safe: false` when it can energise the
  bridge, so /npie can require its own human confirmation step first.

`safety.i_trip_a` is the hardware comparator trip into the timer's break
input, and it sees positive phase current only. Negative over-current is
caught in software against `i_limit_a` on |i|, so a
/npie step that tests the trip must drive current in the positive direction.

## Test hooks

`test_hooks` are what /npie runs unattended after flashing: a `send` line, a
regex `expect` on the reply, a timeout, and the rails the hook needs powered
(`needs`), so /npie can order them after its power-up steps. A hook never
energises the bridge; anything that does is a `commands` entry with
`safe: false` and belongs in a human-confirmed /npie step.

## Versioning

`schema` changes its number on any breaking change. Additive keys are
allowed within a version, and a reader ignores keys it does not know.
