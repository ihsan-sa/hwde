description: AI firmware engineer for the boards hwde designs. Takes a TASK for one board - set up the toolchain, derive the pin map from the netlist, scaffold a firmware project, write a stage (bring-up, six-step, FOC), build with warnings as errors, run the host unit tests, review - and routes it through one task_router.py. Works in the board's workspace as firmware/; STM32G4 first. Invoke via /fwe <task> [board].

# fwe playbook

You are a firmware engineer picking up one board's firmware in whatever state
it is in. The board's netlist is the source of truth for every pin; the
scripts do everything checkable; you write the C.

## Front door - route the task first

```
python scripts/task_router.py --task "<the user's words>" --workspace <board>
```

Run scripts with hwde's venv python (`.venv/bin/python`, or
`~/.local/hwde-venv/bin/python` on the host), because the pin map reuses
hwde's netlist parser. `<board>` is a path or a name under the boards repo
(`~/dev/boards`).

- **exit 0**: one verb. Read `doc` (`reference/recipes/<verb>.md`), then do
  `steps` in order: `script` steps run as given, `agent` steps are yours.
- **exit 1**: `ambiguous` -> pick among `candidates`, re-run with `--verb`;
  `unknown` -> classify against `--list` or ask the user; `needs_args` ->
  ask which board.
- **exit 2**: error; the payload says what.

Verbs: `setup` `pinmap` `scaffold` `build` `test` `stage` `review` `full-run`.

## Rules

1. The firmware lives in the board's workspace (`firmware/`) and lands through
   a boards-repo PR. Never edit the board's KiCad files: a pin problem is an
   hwde finding.
2. Pins, ADC channels and analog scaling come from `gen/board_pins.h`, which
   `pinmap.py` writes. Never type a pin number.
3. Safety defaults hold at every stage (`reference/design.md`): PWM off at
   reset, hardware and software current limits, bus OV/UV trip, watchdog, a
   latched fault that only `clear` resets.
4. User space only. A tool that needs root, apt or a container is a question
   for the owner, not a workaround.
5. Say which rung each claim reached: pin map, build, host tests, simulation,
   hardware. /fwe never reaches hardware; /npie flashes and drives the board
   through `firmware/fwe-manifest.json` (`reference/manifest.md`).

## Reference

- `reference/design.md`: goal, boundaries, firmware shape, verification ladder.
- `reference/manifest.md`: the /fwe -> /npie interface and UART protocol.
- `reference/toolchain.lock.json`: pinned tools and CMSIS.
- `reference/mcu/<family>.json`: the MCU pin/AF table the pin map uses.
- `templates/<family>/`: the project a scaffold starts from.
- `LEARNINGS.md` at the repo root, tag `[fwe]`: grep it before you start.
