## 2026-07-06 [windows] cp1252 console crashes on non-ASCII output
Printing degree signs, ohms, plus-minus, emoji to a default Windows console raises
UnicodeEncodeError. Every script does `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")`
and keeps its own strings ASCII. (Source: ai-ee2, re-affirmed S0.)

## 2026-07-06 [windows] Python does not resolve MSYS /c/ paths
Bash redirects understand `/c/dev/...`; Python `open()` does not. Always pass `C:/dev/...`
style to Python. Bit prior attempts in bash-heredoc + `python -c` mixes. (Source: ai-ee2.)

## 2026-07-06 [kicad] File formats are not forward-compatible - pin ONE KiCad
A KiCad-10-format board is unreadable by kicad-cli 9 (exit 3). This host has 8.0/9.0.5/10.0.3
side by side. The whole pipeline resolves kicad-cli, bundled python, and templates through
`scripts/lib/env.py` (pinned: 10.0.3; AIEE_KICAD_CLI overrides). Never mix versions mid-pipeline.
(Source: ai-ee2 spike; enforced here at S0.)

## 2026-07-06 [kicad-cli] Host quirks: not on PATH; refill-zones is 10.x-only; pos defaults to inches
kicad-cli is NOT on PATH (full path via env.py). `pcb drc --refill-zones --save-board` exists on
10.0.3 but NOT 9.0.5 (S0-verified) - a reason KiCad 10 is the pin. From prior attempts (re-verify
at S2/S12): `pcb export pos` defaults to INCHES (pass `--units mm`); pos CSV headers are
Ref,Val,Package,PosX,PosY,Rot,Side with Side values top/bottom; ERC json nests violations
per-sheet while DRC's are flat.

## 2026-07-06 [ipc] No `kicad-cli api-server` in 9.0.5/10.0.3 - sandboxed-GUI IPC works instead
kipy 0.7.1 ships kipy/server.py driving `kicad-cli api-server`, but that subcommand exists in
neither installed KiCad (spec's "headless=True" claim corrected). S0-verified working path:
launch pcbnew.exe with KICAD_CONFIG_HOME pointed at a scratch config that sets
api.enable_server=true and seeds empty fp/sym-lib-tables (skips first-run dialogs) -> kipy
connects and reads the board; user's real config untouched. Automated in scripts/smoke_ipc.py.
A PCB editor window appears (fine on this desktop host). Headless alternative: SWIG bundled python.

## 2026-07-06 [swig] pcbnew lives in KiCad's BUNDLED bin/python.exe, verified on 9.0.5 and 10.0.3
The venv python has no pcbnew; the bundled one roundtrips CreateEmptyBoard/Save/LoadBoard and has
ExportSpecctraDSN + ImportSpecctraSES on both versions (S0-verified). Prior-attempt gotchas to
re-verify at first SWIG use (S9/S11): Specctra export WEDGES headless on a wx assert unless
suppressed (make wx.App, wx.DisableAsserts(), APP_ASSERT_SUPPRESS); bulk board.Remove() of
tracks/vias corrupts the process heap (do reads first, then save + fresh interpreter);
GetCourtyard() is empty until fp.BuildCourtyardCaches(); bundled python maps bare /tmp to C:\tmp.

## 2026-07-06 [freerouting] 2.2.4 needs Java 25 (not "21+"); batch flags are non-obvious
Java 24 fails with UnsupportedClassVersionError - portable Temurin 25 vendored at tools/jre/
(gitignored; check_env remediation has the re-fetch URL). Batch recipe from prior attempts
(re-verify at S11): `--gui.enabled=false -de in.dsn -do out.ses -mp <passes> -da`; `-da` is
mandatory or it phones home and can stall; `-h` not `--help` (--help launches the GUI). Do not
trust FR's success signal or internal DRC: parse the "(N unrouted)" completion line and gate on
kicad-cli DRC only.

## 2026-07-06 [easyeda2kicad] Imported footprints: missing courtyards + library defects + UA 403s
Prior attempts found easyeda2kicad imports lack courtyard geometry (courtyard-based checks
silently degrade) and can ship self-violating footprints (EP pad with no net, thermal drills
under min-hole). S6's fp_verify must check courtyard presence and a per-part DRC baseline.
EasyEDA endpoints 403 some default User-Agents (browser UA passes). Output layout:
`<base>.pretty/<name>.kicad_mod` + `<base>.kicad_sym`. (Source: both attempts; re-verify S6.)

## 2026-07-06 [python] skidl prints env-var warnings on import - keep JSON stdout clean
Importing skidl without KICAD*_SYMBOL_DIR set emits warnings; check_env redirects
stdout/stderr around package imports so its JSON contract holds. Do the same in any script
importing skidl/kicad_sch_api before emitting JSON.

## 2026-07-06 [python] skidl drops `<script>.log` / `<script>.erc` files in CWD on import
Merely importing skidl creates log/erc files named after the running script (or `skidl_REPL.*`
from `python -c`) in the current directory - the litter visible in AI-EE's repo root. Import
skidl with CWD pointed at scratch (`contextlib.chdir`, see check_env.py) or expect droppings;
gitignore patterns added as backstop. Applies to S7 schematic tooling.

## 2026-07-06 [prior-attempts] Deep routing/placement/fab gotchas archived in the old repos
C:/dev/ai-ee2/LEARNINGS.md and C:/dev/AI-EE/docs/LEARNINGS.md hold machine-verified findings
(2-layer GND-pour fragmentation, stitch-via keepouts, header pin-order routability lever, JLC
CPL rotation handling, wx/SWIG details). Consult them before S9-S12 sessions for FACTS ONLY -
do not port their architecture (user directive: this build follows SPEC.md fresh).
