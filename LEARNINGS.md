## 2026-07-06 [windows] cp1252 console crashes on non-ASCII output
Printing degree signs, ohms, plus-minus, emoji to a default Windows console raises
UnicodeEncodeError. Every script does `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")`
and keeps its own strings ASCII. (Source: ai-ee2, re-affirmed S0.)

## 2026-07-06 [windows] Python does not resolve MSYS /c/ paths
Bash redirects understand `/c/dev/...`; Python `open()` does not. Always pass `C:/dev/...`
style to Python. Bit prior attempts in bash-heredoc + `python -c` mixes. (Source: ai-ee2.)

## 2026-07-06 [kicad] File formats are not forward-compatible - pin ONE KiCad
A KiCad-10-format board is unreadable by kicad-cli 9 (exit 3). This host has 8.0/9.0.5/10.0.3
side by side. The whole pipeline resolves kicad-cli, bundled python, and templates through
`scripts/lib/env.py` (pinned: 10.0.3; AIEE_KICAD_CLI overrides). Never mix versions mid-pipeline.
(Source: ai-ee2 spike; enforced here at S0.)

## 2026-07-06 [kicad-cli] Host quirks: not on PATH; refill-zones is 10.x-only; pos defaults to inches
kicad-cli is NOT on PATH (full path via env.py). `pcb drc --refill-zones --save-board` exists on
10.0.3 but NOT 9.0.5 (S0-verified) - a reason KiCad 10 is the pin. From prior attempts (re-verify
at S2/S12): `pcb export pos` defaults to INCHES (pass `--units mm`); pos CSV headers are
Ref,Val,Package,PosX,PosY,Rot,Side with Side values top/bottom; ERC json nests violations
per-sheet while DRC's are flat.

## 2026-07-06 [ipc] No `kicad-cli api-server` in 9.0.5/10.0.3 - sandboxed-GUI IPC works instead
kipy 0.7.1 ships kipy/server.py driving `kicad-cli api-server`, but that subcommand exists in
neither installed KiCad (spec's "headless=True" claim corrected). S0-verified working path:
launch pcbnew.exe with KICAD_CONFIG_HOME pointed at a scratch config that sets
api.enable_server=true and seeds empty fp/sym-lib-tables (skips first-run dialogs) -> kipy
connects and reads the board; user's real config untouched. Automated in scripts/smoke_ipc.py.
A PCB editor window appears (fine on this desktop host). Headless alternative: SWIG bundled python.

## 2026-07-06 [swig] pcbnew lives in KiCad's BUNDLED bin/python.exe, verified on 9.0.5 and 10.0.3
The venv python has no pcbnew; the bundled one roundtrips CreateEmptyBoard/Save/LoadBoard and has
ExportSpecctraDSN + ImportSpecctraSES on both versions (S0-verified). Prior-attempt gotchas to
re-verify at first SWIG use (S9/S11): Specctra export WEDGES headless on a wx assert unless
suppressed (make wx.App, wx.DisableAsserts(), APP_ASSERT_SUPPRESS); bulk board.Remove() of
tracks/vias corrupts the process heap (do reads first, then save + fresh interpreter);
GetCourtyard() is empty until fp.BuildCourtyardCaches(); bundled python maps bare /tmp to C:\tmp.

## 2026-07-06 [freerouting] 2.2.4 needs Java 25 (not "21+"); batch flags are non-obvious
Java 24 fails with UnsupportedClassVersionError - portable Temurin 25 vendored at tools/jre/
(gitignored; check_env remediation has the re-fetch URL). Batch recipe from prior attempts
(re-verify at S11): `--gui.enabled=false -de in.dsn -do out.ses -mp <passes> -da`; `-da` is
mandatory or it phones home and can stall; `-h` not `--help` (--help launches the GUI). Do not
trust FR's success signal or internal DRC: parse the "(N unrouted)" completion line and gate on
kicad-cli DRC only.

## 2026-07-06 [easyeda2kicad] Imported footprints: missing courtyards + library defects + UA 403s
Prior attempts found easyeda2kicad imports lack courtyard geometry (courtyard-based checks
silently degrade) and can ship self-violating footprints (EP pad with no net, thermal drills
under min-hole). S6's fp_verify must check courtyard presence and a per-part DRC baseline.
EasyEDA endpoints 403 some default User-Agents (browser UA passes). Output layout:
`<base>.pretty/<name>.kicad_mod` + `<base>.kicad_sym`. (Source: both attempts; re-verify S6.)

## 2026-07-06 [python] skidl prints env-var warnings on import - keep JSON stdout clean
Importing skidl without KICAD*_SYMBOL_DIR set emits warnings; check_env redirects
stdout/stderr around package imports so its JSON contract holds. Do the same in any script
importing skidl/kicad_sch_api before emitting JSON.

## 2026-07-06 [python] skidl drops `<script>.log` / `<script>.erc` files in CWD on import
Merely importing skidl creates log/erc files named after the running script (or `skidl_REPL.*`
from `python -c`) in the current directory - the litter visible in AI-EE's repo root. Import
skidl with CWD pointed at scratch (`contextlib.chdir`, see check_env.py) or expect droppings;
gitignore patterns added as backstop. Applies to S7 schematic tooling.

## 2026-07-06 [prior-attempts] Deep routing/placement/fab gotchas archived in the old repos
C:/dev/ai-ee2/LEARNINGS.md and C:/dev/AI-EE/docs/LEARNINGS.md hold machine-verified findings
(2-layer GND-pour fragmentation, stitch-via keepouts, header pin-order routability lever, JLC
CPL rotation handling, wx/SWIG details). Consult them before S9-S12 sessions for FACTS ONLY -
do not port their architecture (user directive: this build follows SPEC.md fresh).

## 2026-07-11 [swig] pcbnew.ZONE_FILLER segfaults headless on Windows 10.0.3 - fill via kicad-cli
ZONE_FILLER(board).Fill(...) segfaults the bundled python headless (with or without the wx.App
+ DisableAsserts recipe). Working pattern (used by tests/golden/generators): build+save the board
UNFILLED via SWIG, then `kicad-cli pcb drc --refill-zones --save-board` fills and persists (fill
survives; a later plain DRC is clean). Also: board.Save() writes a DEFAULT .kicad_pro next to the
board, clobbering any custom one - write the project file AFTER pcb generation.

## 2026-07-11 [kicad] .kicad_pro is the DRC/ERC authority; keep it minimal and hand-rolled
With a .kicad_pro present, DRC rules come from the PROJECT, not the board's embedded setup
(pcb_build's ds.m_TrackMinWidth is ignored; KiCad's 0.2 mm default applied until
board.design_settings.rules.min_track_width went into the pro). rule_severities overrides
(lib_symbol_issues/lib_footprint_issues/footprint_link_issues/lib_symbol_mismatch: ignore) work
from a MINIMAL pro, but pasting the full default-shaped blob (defaults/net_settings/teardrops...)
made KiCad reject/ignore the overrides - warnings returned. Golden corpus: sch_build.write_project.

## 2026-07-11 [python] kicad-sch-api 0.5.6 quirks (verified against kicad-cli 10.0.3 ERC)
(wheel 0.5.6; its __version__ string lies "0.5.5"). Output opens clean in KiCad 10 (V2 evidence).
Gotchas: add_global_label() writes NOTHING to the file (silent no-op) - local labels only, so
root-sheet nets come out "/NAME" in netlists/boards; alphanumeric pin numbers get renumbered when
embedding symbols (USB_B_Micro shield "SH" -> "6") - sch_build._apply_pin_number_fixups repairs
the saved file; a pin touching a wire MID-SPAN does not connect (pins connect at wire ENDPOINTS
only - a PWR_FLAG placed mid-wire ERCs as unconnected); component anchors snap to the 1.27 mm
grid, so off-grid positions silently shift symbols and wires miss pins.

## 2026-07-11 [python] kiutils needs encoding="utf-8" passed explicitly on Windows
SymbolLib/Board/Footprint.from_file default to the locale codec (cp1252) and crash on official
libs containing non-ASCII (RF.kicad_sym). Also kiutils pad size.X/Y are pre-rotation values -
do not derive board-space bounding boxes from them (SMA edge-mount pads are 5.08 mm along X;
kiutils showed 1.5x5.08). Use pcbnew pad dumps (generators/pcb_build.py --pads-out) for geometry.

## 2026-07-11 [kicad] KiCad 10 board files store nets by NAME in segments/vias - mutation surgery
`(net "GND")` (not numeric ids) appears in segment/via/pad blocks, so deterministic text surgery
keyed on coordinates+netnames works (tests/golden/mutations/mutlib.py: exact-match asserts, fixed
UUIDs for added items, refill via kicad-cli after). Double-run byte-identical verified for all 7
mutants. Mutants must be re-run whenever goldens regenerate (gen.py assigns fresh UUIDs).

## 2026-07-11 [kicad-cli] Misc 10.0.3 flags: render uses --width/--height; ERC exit = count
`pcb render` wants --width/--height (-w exists but -h collides with help; use long forms) plus
--quality high. With --exit-code-violations the exit CODE equals the violation count (saw exit 5
= 5 violations) - treat nonzero as "has violations", never as errno. `sch export netlist --format
kicadsexpr` emits multiline-formatted s-exprs (regex across lines, see gen.py parse_netlist).

## 2026-07-11 [kicad-cli][windows] A stale persistent AIEE_KICAD_CLI silently pins the WRONG KiCad
S2 start: env.find_kicad_cli() resolved 9.0.5, not the 10.0.3 pin, because a User-level (registry)
`AIEE_KICAD_CLI` env var pointed at 9.0 - it takes precedence over env.py's 10.x preference (by
design: the documented "flip the pin" override). But 9.0 CANNOT load 10-format goldens (version
20260206): kicad-cli exits 3 "Failed to load board" and writes NO json report, so any wrapper that
reads the report file dies on FileNotFoundError. Removed it via
`[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AIEE_KICAD_CLI",$null,"User")` (old value
C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\kicad-cli.exe). NOTE: a persistent User var is INHERITED by an
already-running shell - deleting the registry value does not clear it from the current process;
`unset AIEE_KICAD_CLI` per shell too. If goldens suddenly "fail to load", suspect this first.

## 2026-07-11 [kicad-cli] DRC/ERC JSON: layer/net/refdes are embedded in item description strings
kicad-cli violation objects are `{type, severity, description, items:[{description, pos{x,y},
uuid}]}`. There are NO separate layer/net/ref fields - they live in the item description text:
"Pad 1 [GND] of D1 on F.Cu" -> net in [brackets], layer after " on ", refdes = [A-Z]{1,4}\d+ (strip
[brackets] FIRST or bracketed pin names like [PB0] get mis-read as refdes). DRC report has three
parallel sections that share this shape and must be merged: violations + unconnected_items +
schematic_parity; ERC nests per sheet under sheets[].violations. `--severity-all` is required or
warnings are omitted. Normalizer + parsers: scripts/kc.py (parse_drc_data / parse_erc_data).

## 2026-07-11 [kicad] cpl-rotation mutant does NOT fail --schematic-parity (manifest note is wrong)
S2 spot-check: `pcb drc --schematic-parity` on the committed tests/golden/mutants/cpl-rotation board
reports 0 violations under 10.0.3, contradicting manifest.yaml's note ("intentionally fails
--schematic-parity too"). The board IS mutated (test_golden proves it differs from golden), and its
DESIGNATED catcher is dfm_check (S12, CPL polarity), not parity - so this is a stale secondary claim,
not a broken fixture. S12 must catch it via CPL/polarity validation, NOT lean on parity. Registered
as verify-later V9.
